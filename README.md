# Speech-Enabled Chatbot
## 🎯 What You're Aiming For
In this exercise, we will combine the speech recognition and chatbot algorithms to create a speech-enabled chatbot. The chatbot will take voice input from the user, transcribe it into text using the speech recognition algorithm, and then use the chatbot algorithm to generate a response.

### Note: Before attempting this exercise, make sure you have installed the necessary packages, including nltk, streamlit, and speech_recognition.
## ℹ️ Instructions
### Import Necessary Packages: 
Ensure you have installed the required packages: nltk, streamlit, and speech_recognition.

### Load and Preprocess Data: 
Load the text file and preprocess the data using the chatbot algorithm.

### Transcribe Speech to Text: 
Define a function to transcribe speech into text using the speech recognition algorithm.

### Modify Chatbot Function: 
Modify the chatbot function to take both text and speech input from the user. If the user provides text input, the chatbot should function as before. If the user provides speech input, the speech recognition algorithm should transcribe the speech into text, which is then passed to the chatbot.

### Create Streamlit App: 
Create a Streamlit app that allows the user to provide either text or speech input to the chatbot. The chatbot's response should be displayed to the user.

### Test the Chatbot: 
Test the chatbot with both text and speech input to ensure it functions correctly.

## 📝 Note
Test the app thoroughly to ensure it is working correctly.
Consider user experience and design the app to be intuitive and easy to use.
Consult documentation or seek help from the community if you encounter any issues.
